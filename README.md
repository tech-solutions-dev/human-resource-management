## Introduction

Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) are essential for modern organizations, streamlining HR functions such as recruitment, payroll, performance management, and employee transfers. This project aims to address inefficiencies and outdated practices in HRMS, focusing on employee transfer management, data accuracy, and workflow automation.

## Problem Statement

Inefficient employee transfer processes and fragmented HR data systems cause operational delays and compliance risks. Poor data management hampers strategic decision-making and leads to financial losses. This project seeks to solve these challenges by building a modern, integrated HRMS.

## Objectives

**General Objective:**  
Design and develop an enhanced HRMS that facilitates efficient employee transfers and accurate data management.

**Specific Objectives:**
- Analyze limitations of existing HRMS platforms.
- Design a user-friendly interface for digital transfer requests.
- Implement a centralized, accurate employee records database.
- Integrate automated notifications and approval workflows.
- Evaluate system performance (speed, accuracy, user satisfaction).

## Research Questions

1. What are the main limitations of current HRMS solutions in managing employee transfers?
2. How can a digital platform improve the accuracy and speed of employee transfer processes?
3. What features are necessary in an enhanced HRMS to improve organizational workflow?
4. How can automated workflows improve HR decision-making and accountability?

## Scope

- Employee data registration, updating, and retrieval.
- Requesting, approving, and tracking employee transfers.
- HR user management and role-based access control.
- Notification system (email/SMS integration).
- Data visualization and report generation.
- Initial focus: medium-sized organizations, scalable for future needs.

## Significance

- **Operational Efficiency:** Automation reduces HR workload and speeds up processes.
- **Data Accuracy:** Centralized database minimizes errors and duplication.
- **Transparency:** Clear visibility into transfer status and approvals.
- **User-Centric Design:** Intuitive UI and role-based access.
- **Scalability:** Architecture supports organizational growth.

## Methodology

- Requirement gathering (interviews, surveys).
- System design (UML, wireframes).
- **Development:**
  - Backend: Node.js (Express, Sequelize, MySQL)
  - Frontend: React, Bootstrap
  - Database: MySQL (initial), PostgreSQL (optional)
- Testing (unit, integration, UAT).
- Deployment (cloud/on-premises).
- Evaluation (user feedback, performance metrics).

## Expected Outcomes

- Functional HRMS with employee data and transfer modules.
- Efficient transfer request and approval workflows.
- Transparent, accountable HR operations.
- Reduced administrative delays and errors.
- User-friendly dashboards and reporting tools.

## Backend

### Backend Tech Stack

- **Node.js** (Express.js)
- **Sequelize** ORM
- **MySQL** (default, can be swapped for PostgreSQL)
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Nodemailer** (for email notifications)
- **Jest** (for testing)
- **Other:** dotenv, express-validator, helmet, cors, etc.

### Backend Directory Structure

- `config/` – Database and JWT configuration.
- `controllers/` – Business logic for each resource.
- `database/` – SQL migrations, seeders.
- `middleware/` – Auth, validation, error handling, rate limiting.
- `models/` – Sequelize models.
- `routes/` – Express route definitions.
- `utils/` – Helper functions, email service, etc.

### Backend Setup & Running

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set DB/JWT/email credentials.
3. **Database setup:**
   - Run SQL migrations in `database/migrations/init.sql` on your MySQL server.
4. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Backend Key Features

- User registration, login, profile management (role-based).
- Employee transfer request, approval, and tracking.
- Leave management (request, approve, reject, cancel).
- Department management.
- Notification system (in-app, email).
- Reporting (summary, analytics).
- Secure authentication and authorization.
- Validation, error handling, and rate limiting.

### Backend To Do

- [ ] Implement email/SMS notification integration.
- [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive actions.
- [ ] Expand reporting endpoints (charts, exports).
- [ ] Add pagination and filtering to all list endpoints.
- [ ] Implement password reset and account recovery.
- [ ] Add more granular permissions (custom roles).
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit/integration tests.
- [ ] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
