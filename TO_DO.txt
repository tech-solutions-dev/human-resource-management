1. Connect notifications to leave, transfer and other entities, such that when they are used, Notifications is automatically created.

2. Change notification_types values to "apply_leave,apply_transfer,approve_leave...., and other keywords" so that when any of the transfers type or leave type is created, a corresponding notification too is created. 
    for approved, rejected, this means the notification should be seen by employee. for apply_ and .. keywords, that means the notification should be seen by admin

3. I can implement it at the model level of transfers, leave, etc. so that after creating them, the notifications are automatically created.
3. Username field might be removed, so that it is generated by backend

4. Implement both username or email login usage
